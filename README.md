# Original-Backpropagation-DNN
Implementation of back-propagation from scratch for generalized Deep Neural Networks  
Train, test and validation data needs to be saved as train.csv, test.csv and val.csv respectively.  
Sample run scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/shubhangighosh/Original-Backpropagation-DNN/blob/master/run.sh).  
Hyperparameter descriptions and experimental results can be found [here](https://github.com/shubhangighosh/Original-Backpropagation-DNN/blob/master/Report.pdf).
